# Transfer Learning and Optimization in CNNs for Brain Tumor Detection
In this project, we delve into the realm of deep learning with a focus on brain tumor detection using advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The primary objective is to enhance existing architectures by employing transfer learning techniques and custom optimizations. The dataset comprises 253 high-resolution brain MRI scans, categorized into tumor and non-tumor classes, obtained from Kaggle. The grayscale images, varying in size, serve as the foundation for a comprehensive image analysis.
Our methodology unfolds through a meticulous workflow encompassing data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, optimization, and predictions. Noteworthy preprocessing steps include train-test splitting, data augmentation, and feature scaling. Three benchmark CNNs—ResNet50V2, VGG19, and VGG16—are employed for model building, with each model undergoing iterative cycles of evaluation and optimization. Transfer learning is a key focus, capitalizing on pre-trained models and fine-tuning them to adapt to the intricacies of brain MRI image classification.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, binary cross-entropy, confusion matrix analysis, and inference speed provide a robust foundation for assessing the models' performance. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between TensorFlow and ONNX-based model inference, executed with a CPU execution provider, sheds light on the models' viability for high-performance computing and cross-platform support.
The inference speed comparison highlights the efficiency of each model, showcasing their respective latencies in TensorFlow and ONNX implementations. Results unveil critical insights into the efficacy of the models, revealing nuances in training and testing accuracy, as well as binary cross-entropy loss.
In conclusion, the project accentuates the potential of deep learning in brain tumor detection and emphasizes the significance of transfer learning in optimizing model performance. VGG19, with augmented training data, emerges as a standout performer with an impressive 86% test set classification accuracy, while VGG16, also with augmented training data, exhibits the lowest binary cross-entropy loss of 0.4984. These findings not only contribute to the ongoing discourse in medical image analysis but also provide valuable benchmarks for future endeavors in leveraging deep learning for neuroimaging tasks.
